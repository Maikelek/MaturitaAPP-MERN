# Maturita Interactive Tests

## Maturita 

In Slovakia, the "maturita" is a significant milestone in the education system. It refers to the final examination taken by secondary school students at the end of their studies, typically around the age of 19 or 20. The maturita exams are conducted by the Ministry of Education and evaluate students' knowledge and skills acquired during their years of study. The exams usually cover a range of subjects, including Slovak language and literature, foreign languages, mathematics, and various specialized subjects. Successful completion of the maturita exams is a prerequisite for obtaining a secondary school leaving certificate and gaining access to higher education institutions.
